# Hexagonal Architecture
- "Keep the Controller thin. Business logic must reside in the Service or Domain Model, never in the Web Adapter."

# Domain Driven Design (DDD)
- "The Domain layer should remain as POJO (Plain Old Java Object). Minimize dependencies on infrastructure technologies like JPA or HTTP."
